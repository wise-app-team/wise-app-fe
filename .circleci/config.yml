# Orbs are reusable packages of CircleCI configuration that you may share across projects, enabling you to create encapsulated, parameterized commands, jobs, and executors that can be used across multiple projects.
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-intro/
orbs:
  ruby: circleci/ruby@1.4.0
  heroku: circleci/heroku@1.2.6
# Define a job to be invoked later in a workflow.
